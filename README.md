Samsoft Universal Jailbreak Research — FOR RESEARCH ONLY

This repository collects prompt patterns, failure cases, and mitigations observed during black-box prompt engineering research. All examples are archived for study, reproduction, and development of jailbreak-resistant systems. 
Usage policy:
• DO NOT use these materials to bypass model safeguards or enable illegal activity.
• Use only with consented/local models or properly provisioned research endpoints.
• Replace any actionable/unsafe examples with sanitized pseudo-prompts before public release.
