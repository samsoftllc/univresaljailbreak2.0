"title": "Samsoft Ultra Simulator", "summary": "The Samsoft Ultra Simulator (UltraSim) is a modern reconstruction of the original 1995 Nintendo Ultra Simulator, rebuilt by Samsoft Studios as part of its archival preservation and educational emulator project. It faithfully reimplements the SGI co-simulation and graphics pipeline models once used for early Nintendo 64 hardware testing, updated with Samsoft’s procedural debugging layer and real-time visualization core. Designed for research and engine development, Samsoft Ultra Simulator bridges historical emulation with contemporary software engineering to recreate the feel of SGI’s prototype environment on modern systems.", "features": { "stop_n_swap": "Dynamic memory state switching system allowing instant hardware or ROM transitions without full reboot.", "multi_language_support": "Seamless execution and hot-swapping of code written in C, ASM, MIPS, C++, or mixed hybrid languages.", "internal_server": "Built-in networked service layer providing local debugging, interprocess messaging, and remote runtime control for Samsoft Engine tools.", "procedural_debugger": "Next-gen visualization debugger capable of live tracing instruction flow, VRAM states, and co-processor signals.", "compatibility_mode": "Accurately simulates early SGI workstation timing and architecture for legacy ROM validation and preservation." } }
